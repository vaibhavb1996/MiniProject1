This is a project undertaken at Boston University in class EC601. 

The aim of this project is to create a python program which does the following:
1. Takes a twitter handle from the user
2. Downloads the images from that twitter handle
3. Compiles a video out of the images using FFMPEG
4. Uses the google cloud intelligence API to figure out a brief description about the stuff being tweeted about.
